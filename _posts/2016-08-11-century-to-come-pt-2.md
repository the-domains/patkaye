# Century to Come Pt. 2

I feel tired

But instead of dying

Who knows I guess I might feel like flying

Give kudos to who you know before you're gone

Life is hard

It's all about who you know and who you love

and staying strong

Letting bygones be bygones

Before you're threatened

Will guarantee you're never leaving cities sweating

A new millennium for young

To build a century to come

Until the kingdom comes

Please hold you're qualms

Henceforth "Pt. 2" Understood

After completing "A Man Must Speak", I reconstructed this arrangement from my first true full length rhyme. Interestingly, I reversed my original sequence of the two verses just to play around; and I ended up rolling with.
