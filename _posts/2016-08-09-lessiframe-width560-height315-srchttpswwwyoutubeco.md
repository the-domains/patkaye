# A Man Must Speak...

It's everyman for himself nobody saw me coming

I live lawfully doubters are dumb

I don't have to stay silent

I'm older and wiser

I don't need the foolish to tell me I'm ruthless

My passion writing is depolarizing

This rap is a movement which I am providing

Relax as my stories capture your emotions

I won't hold back passion and fire
