Before you're placed in a casket

Ask if you can give something back

It isn't that bad living in the masses

Let's all relax in the action we've been tasked with

Without your company

How will I humbly

Prevent this dream from crumbling

Something could come to me

But not unless you're bumping me

To help me all you have to do is tell me

If you like what I got

Or let me know if it's not welcome in you're spot

If it's part of the process of learning how to get products across

Than it's not a lost cause

and it doesn't bother me

Not a lot of beats that I make will be seen

Most will be locked away and passed the way that I die

and lost like a dream

But I still aspire to fill humans with hope

With a set of sounds to cope with

Available on mobile

Before I forget it all

I better learn to solve

on how to return the source

Keep the furnace and the forge

Opened for better warmth

Walking a bath chosen

instead of war

Rip of your set of horns

Don't try to rip off poetic scores

I did my chores so bad don't need a course

Being an artist is a choice
